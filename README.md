# Purpose

Sample project written in .net

# Prerequisites

To be able to setup this example you will need

- shell console - preferred WSL2 and Ubuntu release
- .net 5.0 - current release on date of writing it is: 5.0.0-rc.2

Please not to execute all scripts from containing directory.

# Running contract tests

It's enough for you to run `./scripts/runAcceptanceTests.sh` to

- Build a docker image with Artifactory (normally you would have that running / you could also use Git instead)
- We run the app on port `5000` in the `ContractTests` mode
- We run the Spring Cloud Contract docker image that has the `contracts` folder mounted with contracts
- From the mounted folder tests are generated against the running application
- Once the tests have passed stubs are generated and uploaded to Artifactory

# Runing stubs

It's enough for you to run `./scripts/runStubs.sh` to

- get stubs from Artifactory and run them on specified port with Wiremock
- once the stub runner is running you can test your api against defined contract tests

To learn more about stub runner go to:
